# Leo9 Studio Homepage - Frontend Assignment Submission
This project is a recreation of the navigation bar and hero section of the Leo9 Studio website, completed as a frontend development assignment. The primary focus was on creating a clean, responsive, and functional user interface while also integrating a modern AI-powered feature.

‚ú® Features
Responsive Navigation Bar: A fully responsive navigation bar that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile views.

Functional Mobile Menu: A clean "hamburger" menu for mobile devices, implemented with React state for a smooth user experience.

Clean Hero Section: A well-structured hero section built using modern CSS (Flexbox) for robust and centered alignment.

Interactive Elements: Subtle hover effects on buttons and navigation links to enhance user interaction.

Bonus Feature: Gemini API Integration: An interactive button that utilizes the Google Gemini API to dynamically generate creative web app ideas, showcasing the integration of modern AI services into a frontend application.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Framework: React (Vite)

Styling: CSS3 (Flexbox for Layout)

API: Google Gemini API
